# iris-flower-dataset
Load the Iris dataset into your Python environment. You can use a library like Scikit-learn to load the dataset.

Pre-process the dataset by splitting it into training and testing sets.

Explore the dataset by visualizing the data using scatterplots or histograms.

Select a machine learning algorithm to train your model. You can start with a simple algorithm like K-Nearest Neighbours or Decision Trees.

Train your model using the training set.

Evaluate your model's performance on the testing set.

Use your model to make predictions on new data.

Test your model by inputting new values for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to see the predicted species of iris flower
